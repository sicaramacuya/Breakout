# Breakout

## What the project about?
This project is a clone for the classic arcade Break Out. During the journey of building the game the game was migrated from vanilla JavaScript to an OOP design. At the end the game was bundle and ready for distribution.

## Why it was made?
The goal of this project was to practice the fundamentals of both OOP and Bundling JS projects. The project started following a Mozilla's provided tutorial called <a src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript">2D breakout game using pure JavaScript</a>. As mention before the tutorial use vanilla JavaScript. The first thing to migrade from that code base was using EsLint specifically I used the Airbnb JavaScript style guide to refactor my code. After updating my code I refactored it once more but this time migrating to OOP. Lastly, I bundle the project using Webpack.
